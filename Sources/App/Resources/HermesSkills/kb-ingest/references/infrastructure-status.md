# KB Ingest Infrastructure Status

## Discovery

During the 2026-05-05 session, it was discovered that the expected knowledge base configuration files may not exist in the system:

- `~/.claude/kb-config.json` — NOT FOUND
- `{KB_PATH}/.kb/manifest.json` — NOT FOUND
- `/opt/data/skills/kb-ingest` directory — NOT FOUND (skill exists but no supporting files)

The knowledge base infrastructure appears to be incomplete or not fully set up.

## Manual Workaround

When the expected configuration is missing, use this manual approach to ingest content:

### 1. Determine Vault Path
The user's Obsidian vault is located at:
```
/opt/data/home/obsidian-vault/FACorreia/
```

### 2. Manual Ingest Steps
For web URLs, follow this process:

```bash
# Fetch URL content using curl
curl -s "URL" > /tmp/content.html

# Extract main article content (simplified — in practice, use a tool like readability or manual extraction)
# For now, just save the raw HTML or attempt to clean it

# Generate slug from URL
slug=$(echo "URL" | sed -e 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/-/g' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | cut -c1-60)

# Save to raw/web directory with proper frontmatter
cat > "/opt/data/home/obsidian-vault/FACorreia/Raw/web/$slug.md" << EOF
---
source: URL
ingested_at: $(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
type: web
status: uncompiled
---

$(cat /tmp/content.html)
EOF

echo "Ingested: raw/web/$slug.md"
```

### 3. Important Notes
- The manifest file will not be updated automatically
- Compilation to the wiki must be done manually via `kb-compile` when the infrastructure is available
- For critical ingestion, consider setting up the full knowledge base infrastructure
