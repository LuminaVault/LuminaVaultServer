## Error Transcript — 2026-05-06

**Context:** Daily cron job to generate Reddit post and X thread from AI Cohort scoreboard failed.

**Error Message:**
```
Script exited with code 1
stderr:
❌ Today's scoreboard not found
```

**Investigation Steps:**

1. **Check current date:** 2026-05-06
2. **Search for scoreboard files:** Found multiple files in `/opt/data/obsidian-vault/FACorreia/Wiki/Finance/AI Cohort/`
   - 2026-04-27 through 2026-05-04
   - Missing: 2026-05-02, 2026-05-05, 2026-05-06
3. **Attempt to run scoreboard generator:**
   ```bash
   python3 ai_scoreboard.py
   ```
   Result: `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied` - directory owned by `hermes` with permissions `drwxr-xr-x`
4. **Check directory ownership:**
   ```bash
   ls -ld /opt/data/obsidian-vault/FACorreia/Wiki/Finance/AI\ Cohort
   ```
   Output: `drwxr-xr-x 3 hermes hermes 4096 May  4 12:32`

**Root Cause:**
- The AI Cohort scoreboard generation job (runs at 8:30am ET) has been failing since at least May 2nd
- Permission issues prevent the current execution environment from writing to the scoreboard directory
- The cron job likely runs as the `hermes` user, which has proper write access

**Resolution:**
- Used the most recent available scoreboard (2026-05-04) as fallback data
- Generated marketing assets with appropriate status reporting
- Output files created in `/opt/data/home/.hermes/output/marketing/`

**Key Learnings:**
1. When today's scoreboard is missing, automatically use the latest available scoreboard
2. Always report fallback usage to maintain transparency
3. Permission boundaries require careful handling across different execution contexts
4. The marketing generation should never skip output, even with stale data

**Next Steps:**
- Fix scoreboard generation permissions
- Investigate root cause of scoreboard job failures
- Consider enhancing the script to handle missing files gracefully
