# HER-131 — shared helpers for the encrypted backup + restore scripts.
#
# Sourced by scripts/backup.sh and scripts/restore.sh. Holds nothing that
# runs on its own; just logging, env validation, remote-path normalization,
# and tiered retention pruning. Keep this POSIX-ish but bash is assumed
# (mapfile / arrays) — the backup image installs bash.

# --- Logging -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Timestamped lines to stderr and, when writable, to $BACKUP_LOG_DIR/backup.log.
# stderr (not stdout) so a script can still pipe structured data on stdout.
